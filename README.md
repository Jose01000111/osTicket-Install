<h1>osTicket -Instalation</h1>
This lab will initiate the process of creating a real-world IT helpdesk environment by installing osTicket on an Azure VM. The installation will set up the environment to manage users and helpdesk professionals, enabling the creation of support workflows, SLAs, and ticket management operations. This setup will serve as the foundation for preparing for the CompTIA A+ certification and building the practical skills needed for a future IT role.<br />
